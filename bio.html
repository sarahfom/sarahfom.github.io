			Origin
		</h1>
		<p>
			How I became interested in computer science was by attending a summer program at Boston university. Throughout the duration of this program, I was introduced to different concepts of computing. By the end of the program, I was able to create a text-based horror game to present to my peers and parents. I was in awe by the realization that programming can be used outside of its traditional purposes. Programming can be utilized to create art, movie scripts, etc. As a result of developing that curiosity for what one can accomplish with software, it has led me to be open-minded to amazing learning opportunities.

				Birding
			</h3>
			<p>
				During my senior year of high school, I was invited to go out onto an all-day birding expedition. I showed up with my hiking gear and a camera. They handed me a set of binoculars to search for birds with, but I found that using the zoom on my camera helped me get a better view of all the birds. Whenever we spotted a bird, I ended up taking a picture. Ever since then, it has sparked a lifelong interest in photography and ornithology.
